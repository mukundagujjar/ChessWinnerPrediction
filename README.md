This project is for chess winner prediction from a set of chess moves.<br />
The "chess.py" file contains the main machine learning model.<br />
The "app.py" contains deployment using FastAPI.<br />
The "chess.py" is required for taking input moves for prediction on the server via the "app.py" file.<br />
The "games.csv" file is the dataset used for training the machine learning model.<br />
<br />
The model will return 0 if "black" is the predicted winner and 1 if "white" is the predicted winner.
